## Part 1
- After creating a react app we made a new folder in it called "`backend`"
- Now we installed some npm pakages namely:
```
npm install mongoose
npm install express
```
- We then installed `mongodb` and `mongodb compass` in our computer
- We copied URI from `mongodb compass` and wrote a function to connect our app to mongodb in "`db.js`"
- We exported the function and imported it in our "`index.js`" file to start a connection (by require function)
- We then copied getting started template from express.js website and pasted it in index.js exactly
- Now to start our server we installed "`nodemon`"
```
npm i -D nodemon
```
- Now we started server by 
```
npm nodemon ./index.js
```
- The server got started on the port we gave in our "`index.js`" file
